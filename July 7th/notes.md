Goals:
    -Why doesn't KNN get 100% accuracy? Duplicates?
    -Work on logistic/linear regression, KNN for classification/regression
        -can use others if know how to work/can explain
    -Validation scores, tune, change preprocessing
    -duplicates???? check w/o preprocessing
    -start the paper


 What was Acheived:
    -
Questions:
-Should I modify the hyperparameters? How so?
-Do we want more accuracy or less distance?
-When should I stop tuning parameters and cutting down on preformance?
