Goals:
    -https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2588763 read and try to get hold of networks
    -what other ppl's code may be useful for
    -read about SGD and make questions (https://towardsdatascience.com/stochastic-gradient-descent-clearly-explained-53d239905d31)
    -ask any questions
    -resnet
    -figure out how to take last layer off of resnet, get final 512 features for each image and save as file (pytorch/np.save)
        -need preprocessing, make images all the same size (256x256)
        -naming of folders has to be consistent
        -get resnet on the gpu
    -learn scikit learn and etc., figure how to transform features into labels or scores
    -look at color correction and normalization before running (value ranges for resnet)
