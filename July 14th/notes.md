Goals:
    -Should we explore detection(0 or not) accuracy?
    -maybe try diff evaluation
    -graph log regression based on C
    -try decision tree/forest
    -augment data, rotations/reflections, distortions
        -10 variations, then recompute 
        -diff folders for diff features and plots
        -resample rarer classes more often
        -try different level of resnet
    -numpy quantile when 3 dimensions, features from another layer
    -save stuff in different folders
