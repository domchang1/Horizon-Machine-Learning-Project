Goals:
    -use logistic regression, read about it, map those features to predicted labels
        -https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html
        -https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html
    -try different models (Knn, etc.), make confusion matrices, show distance and right/wrong
    -try linear regression and other regression
    -how does each model work? for paper
    -big plot of confusion matrices, plot title = error rates etc for all the different methods
