Goals:
    -think about 2 problems using basic filter: detecting stop signs (use color), filters to try to determine whether image is of natural or man made scene
       -can take average, max, min to find features; threshold etc.
    -edge filter bigger? 
    -library implementation of convolution: numpy 1D convolution, scipy convolution, scikit-image, 
    -get working with colors, see what to do for classification
    -how to score
    -think about where rectification will come in handy

 What was Acheived:
    -Got venv working, though have to use anaconda prompt (can't figure out otherwise)
    -Got packages installed
    -Created random kernel
    -Used imageio image, np arrays, and matplotlib imshow function
    -Copied over apply function, wrote rectify function
    -Answered questions (basic)
    -Able to display image

Needs to be done:
    -Learn how to get kernels to detect something, convolve them
    -Modify apply function by adding numpy functions where needed
    -Add bias, use rectification, then display

Questions:
    -How do I get kernels to detect something?
    -Where do I use each numpy function in the apply function?
    -How do I add bias?
