Goals:
    -think about 2 problems using basic filter: detecting stop signs (use color), filters to try to determine whether image is of natural or man made scene
       -can take average, max, min to find features; threshold etc.
    -edge filter bigger? 
    -library implementation of convolution: numpy 1D convolution, scipy convolution, scikit-image, 
    -get working with colors, see what to do for classification
    -how to score
    -think about where rectification will come in handy

 What was Acheived:
    -made bigger edge filters and increased magnitude of values: a lot higher range of values/colors, better edge detection, slower 
    -imported scipy, using signal.convolve which is a lot faster
    -starting to compare stop sign, skyscraper, and cat
    -rectification will help to eliminate the very deep colored, more uniform and smaller range of values probably

Needs to be done:
