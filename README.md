My Work With Horizon Academic Research Program:

I learned the basics of Machine Learning and Image Analysis in Python with the help of libraries PyTorch, Pandas, and Numpy. 
After completing the models and obtaining results, I completed a paper titled "A Comparison of Classification and Regression Methods in the Diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy".
