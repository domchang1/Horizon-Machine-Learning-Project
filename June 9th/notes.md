Goals:
    -two types of variation: informative vs nuisance (not helpful)
    -list nuisance variations: size, left vs right and come up with remedy
        -size: resize to same width (?) while keeping same aspect ratio
        -left vs right: can mirror (reflect across y axis) to left (or right) for all images
    -read papers on machine vision on eye data (google scholar, kaggle)

            -"FP is a common ophthalmic imaging technique, in which optical cameras are used to obtain enlarged images of retinal tissues; these retinal photographs are suitable for monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment planning with respect to eye diseases."
            -"Gulshan et al. were the first to use a deep CNN (DCNN) for automated detection of DR [54]. In another study, with a large-scale dataset (494,661 retinal images), a DL system was developed to automatically detect DR, glaucoma, and AMD with respective AUCs of 93.6, 94.2 and 93.1% [55]. Keel and colleagues developed a DL-based DR screening model for use in an endocrinology outpatient clinic, which resulted in 96% patient satisfaction [56]."
            -Takahashi et al. constructed fundus images of four different shooting directions and trained the GoogleNet DCNN to study single fundus images or four synthetic fundus photos intelligently [58].

            -sensitivity: proportion of true positives that are correctly predicted, ability to designate an individual with disease as positive
            -specificity: proportion of true negatives that are correctly predicted
    -install pytorch, learn about it
    -researching stages of deterioration

    -learn about machine learning, learning step
        -stochastic gradient descent: optimization algorithm to find the model parameters that correspond to the best fit between predicted and actual outputs
            -iteratively makes small adjustments,
