Goals:
    -come up with formula to compute g from image directly
    -given 2 kernels (1 for image to feature map f, 1 for f to g) 
        -something about matrix of dot products of the matrices
    -answer: why is relu necessary? Can a useful CNN be made up of only convolutions (no rectification)?
        -relu increases the nonlinearity, is a lot faster, computationally inexpensive
    -setup python venv w/ numpy, imageio; design kernels to detect something interesting, convolve some 
    -images with those kernels (maybe numpy function for inner loop, dot & sum function), normalize brightness,
    -try adding bias term, then using rectification, either save images or display using imshow in matplotlib

 What was Acheived / Not:
    -Got venv working, though have to use anaconda prompt (can't figure out otherwise)
    -Got packages installed
    -
