Goals:
    -visualizing process at every step
    -try to show each image with stop sign heat map, score > threshold
    -find good thresholds
    -using best threshold, calculate accuracy rate
    -changing threshold based on careful/conservative or not missing anything
    -plot curve of false positive/negative based on threshold
    -google roc curve: true positive (sensitivity) vs false positive rate
    -some form of rotation working
