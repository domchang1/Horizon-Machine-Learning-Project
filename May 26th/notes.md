Goals:
    -Testing system, what?
    -10 images of each (no or yes stop sign)
    -convert image of stop sign to kernel?
    -get actual stop sign image
    -resize images and kernel with scikit-image
    -1 kernel size and many image sizes, compare results of convolve by rescaling to match largest
    -image with brightest in middle of stop sign, then darker as going to outside
    -threshold scaled based on brightness of neighbors in that region (brightness = b&w value), divide by brightness
    -Add small number to denominator to prevent /0 and noise
    -Affine transformation, shear image?
    -scale is important, then transformations
    -experiment with scales
