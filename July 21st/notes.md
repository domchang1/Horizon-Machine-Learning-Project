Goals:
    -2 different y-axes one for accuracy other for distance, label graphs (axes and variable)
    -combine graphs etc.
    -set y limit to 0, have same limits 
    -maybe try lasso and ridge? show graph for linear regression
    -confusion matrices for each model family (only best) to see kind of mistakes
    -regression confusion matrics-violin plot from seaborn
    -try augmented images
