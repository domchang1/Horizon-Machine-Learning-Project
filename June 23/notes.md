Goals:
    -look at preprocessing needed for imagenet, transforms.normalize
        -https://github.com/pytorch/vision/issues/39 preprocessing
        -
    -how to run pytorch module on image, look at images expected (transformations needed)
    -get the features for training and test set, put in folder with pickle files
    -scikit learn for some regression, predict diagnosis from features

 What was Acheived:
    -Fri: preprocessing found, working on getting features to file
    -Sat: got features into file and into folders (both train and test), cleaned up main
    -Monday: copied over image classifier
    -Tues:
    -Wed:...
Needs to be done:
